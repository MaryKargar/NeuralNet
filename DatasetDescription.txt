/**
 * ABOUT THE DATASET bodyfat.tsv (freely available dataset).
 *
 * The bodyfat dataset contains estimates of the percentage of body fat
 * determined by underwater weighing and various body circumference measurements
 * for 252 men. Accurate measurement of body fat is very expensive, but by using
 * machine learning it is possible to calculate a prediction with good accuracy
 * by just using some low cost measurements of the body. The columns in the
 * dataset are the following:
 *
 * Percent body fat (%) => this is the decision column (what we want to get from
 * the model).
 * Age (years)
 * Weight (lbs)
 * Height (inches)
 * Neck circumference (cm)
 * Chest circumference (cm)
 * Abdomen 2 circumference (cm)
 * Hip circumference (cm)
 * Thigh circumference (cm)
 * Knee circumference (cm)
 * Ankle circumference (cm)
 * Biceps (extended) circumference (cm)
 * Forearm circumference (cm)
 * Wrist circumference (cm)
 * Density determined from underwater weighing
